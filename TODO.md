# TODO
## Translation
- Translation is mostly done but theres a few things left
- 1. Need a way to supply open AI API key
  - We could either use BEM key to get it from itw server
  - Or we could supply it in github settings
2. We need to have 2 way storage of which files were translated
  - SOMEWHERE in build process, fetch TRANSLATED from branch, then store the new translated files
3. Other things
  - test automatic link system that rewrites links for languages
